<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>Here are some hints on how to use this website.</p>
<ol>
	<li>To get started go to
	<a href="{% url 'active' %}">Active Contests</a>;
	you can then enter any contest for which the window has started.</li>
	<li>You do <i>not</i> need to register a user account to participate.
	When you enter a contest, you will be asked for just a name and email
	(no password), and once you submit this information
	the timer will start automatically.</li>
	<li>When you enter a contest,
		you will be given a special link to a page
		where you can enter answers.
		We use this link in lieu of an account/password system,
		so be careful not to lose it.</li>
	<li>The format of contests may vary; see each contest for
		more information.
		In general, each contest will have a time limit
		and a set of problems with fixed weights.</li>
</ol>
